![Jon May]({{ site.url }}/assets/about.png){: .about}

Not sure what should be said here so here's a placeholder:

I’m a Product Manager with 5+ years of experience in software development creating B2B apps on iOS, Android, and Windows. I have experience defining and measuring product KPIs, executing teams against a product roadmap, and conducting user research. I believe success is achieved through a deep understanding of your product’s customer and making decisions informed by direct user feedback.
