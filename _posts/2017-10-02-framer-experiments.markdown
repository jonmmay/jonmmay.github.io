Largely inspired by Tony Jing's 100 Days of Framer, I sought to learn Framer through dissecting how other people have been using Framer. These are from many months ago and I'd like to give credit where credit is due but I need to do some homework and find the original links. In the meantime, here is a link to [Tony Jing's 100 Days of Framer](http://tonyxj.github.io/100daysofframer/).

I believe these are listed in the order they were created. There are more not included below in my [Github repo](https://github.com/jonmmay/Framer-experiments).

PS, Each gif is accompanied by a link to the Framer prototype. Anyone can click the link to see the prototypes in action!

# iOS Lock Screen Prototype

In this prototype I experimented with blur layers but more importantly, "-webkit-mask" and "mix-blend-mode". It appears that Framer's default "blur" Layer property leverages the CSS "filter" style which doesn't quite meet my expectations or compare to iOS' blur and vibrancy effect. I played around with "-webkit-backdrop-filter" which looks nicer but I found that this didn't work on mobile.

It was still a really fun challenge and I'm impressed with Framer Studio's capabilities! One thing to note: there are many layers with varying degree of blurring and filtering which results in a less-than-performant experience.

Inspiration from [Tony Jing's Day 15: iOS Lock Screen](http://tonyxj.github.io/100daysofframer/day11-20.html).
